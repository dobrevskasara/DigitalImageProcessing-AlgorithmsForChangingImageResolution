Changing the resolution of images, or image resampling, is the process of adjusting the size of digital images to improve quality or adapt them for different purposes. This field in vision has advanced significantly, enabling the creation of computer-generated images with better quality and more details.

Classic methods for changing resolution, such as nearest neighbor and bicubic interpolation, are simple and fast but often result in quality loss. Modern machine learning methods generate higher-quality and more realistic results but are slower and more complex.

The goal of this project is to describe and implement the most commonly used algorithms for changing resolution and analyze their performance in terms of quality and speed. This analysis will help in selecting the most appropriate method for different applications.
